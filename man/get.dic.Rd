\title{Extract Deviance Information Criterion for a fitted model}

\description{Calculates the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) for a model fitted using JAGS.}

\usage{
get.dic(jagsfit)
}

\arguments{
  \item{jagsfit}{The \code{jags.model} component of the output, from a model fitted using \code{boral} with \code{save.model = TRUE}.}
}

\details{
Details regarding the Deviance Information Criterion may be found in (Spiegelhalter et al., 2002; Ntzoufras, 2011; Gelman et al., 2013). The DIC here is based on the conditional log-likelihood i.e., the latent variables (and row effects if applicable) are treated as "fixed effects". A DIC based on the marginal likelihood is obtainable from \code{\link{get.more.measures}}, although this requires a much longer time to compute. For models with overdispered count data, conditional DIC may not perform as well as marginal DIC (Millar, 2009)
}

\value{
DIC value for the jags model.

This function and consequently the DIC value is automatically returned when a model is fitted using \code{\link{boral}} with \code{calc.ics = TRUE}.
